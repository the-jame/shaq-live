# Discord Chat Bot
***
This is a simple bot made for my personal Discord server. Now with AI!


__The normal chat commands are:__
* `ai <string>`: Bot will answer with a response generated by OpenAI Davinci-003
* `say <string>`: Bot says the string in text-to-speech.
* `roll <integer>`: Make the bot randomly roll from 1 to your number.
* `8 <question>`: Bot will answer with an 8-ball style response.
* `er`: Bot will answer with a randomly-generated Elden Ring style message.

__The (dumb) chat commands are:__
* `who <question>(optional)`: Bot answers who did the thing that you just asked.
* `why <question>(optional)`: Bot says why something happened by making up an answer using a random proper noun and "reason".
* `whatis <question>`: Bot tells you what the thing you asked is.
* `ballsize|bs <string>`: Bot will tell you the ballsize of the string in question.
* `memes`: List additional commands with image attachment responses. (50+)
